POC App


POC project build in Flutter.

Project Description (Tools):

I have decided to built this app with Flutter and used GetX for statement management, I gone throught the requirements and decide to choose GetX becauase I think for this requirement GetX could do the job perfectly though if we have more complicated or high rich apps then we can also look out for other options like Provider etc. I guess it all depends on time and requirements.

Couldn't find any available API for this purpose, unfornuataly nor did i have time to also make api else I would have also made the APIs, there I just used fake api via a basic json string response and mapped it

Used simple material app design and used GetX storage for saving data local DB. Used Cached Library for loading images from url so it doesn't have to load each time. 

Drawback

I think the biggest problem with cross platform technologies is optmization, we can just render whole screen like in Flutter so we have to do statement management more carefully.

Improvment.

Well, couldn't give much time else would have worked on more UI and use GetX more efficiently and use it more features, also would have used real api and used exception handler with proper handling of 200 and error codes.
